My solutions for some of the problems in the Euler Project website: https://projecteuler.net/ <br /> <br />
These problems are of a mathematical nature and are solved by writing a computer program. <br /> <br />
The secondary goal of those programs is to run in less than a minute, and I'm trying to run them in less than a second (the goal was invented 21 years ago, when computers weren't as fast as today, so I substituted 1 minute 21 years ago fro 1 second today). I manage to keep up with that goal for most of the programs, but not all. 
Every program has also a timer that prints out the total running time for that specific goal.
