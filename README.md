My solutions for some of the problems in the Euler Project website. https://projecteuler.net/ <br />
These problems are of a mathematical nature and are solved by writing a computer program. <br />
The secondary goal of your program is to run in less than a minute, and I try to run it in  less than a second (the rule was invented 21 years ago, when computers weren't as fast as today). Some problems I manage to finish in that time, some I don't.
